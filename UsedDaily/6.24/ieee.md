# This Amplifier Chip for Light Is Faint No More

- Photonics has long held the promise of microchips that operate faster and consume less energy than their electronic counterparts.
- However, developing such circuitry has proven challenging over the years. One of the primary difficulties involves providing enough output power to yield a strong enough signal. However, researchers have now developed a chip-scale power booster for light with performance roughly as good as those already seen in commercial telecommunications.
  -The ultrabroadband fiber-optic networks that now connect the globe depend on erbium-doped fiber amplifiers that enable ultrafast data rates worldwide. Optical signals must be amplified many times when transmitted over great distances due to signal losses from the optical fibers and other network components. First developed in the 1980s, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers help boost optical signals without the extra step of converting them into electrical signals beforehand. (Specifically, these devices can amplify light in the 1.55-micrometer or 1,550-nanometer wavelength region, where optical fibers experience the fewest transmission losses.)
