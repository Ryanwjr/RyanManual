```haskell
f :: Int -> Int
-- definition of f here
f x = x^2 + 2*x + 4
```

```haskell
g :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
g x y = x * y
```

```haskell
g :: (Int, Int) -> Int
-- definition of g here
g (x, y) = x^2 - y^2
```

```haskell
fact :: Integer -> Integer
fact 0 = 1
fact n = n * fact (n-1)
Note:
We needed to use parentheses around (n-1).
That's because function application has high precedence in Haskell
 f n-1 is interpreted as (f n)-1 by default.
```

```haskell
fact :: Integer -> Integer
fact n
    | n < 0     = 0
    | n == 0    = 1
    | otherwise = n * fact (n-1)
```

- `/` provides float division, even if its arguments are both integers. For integer division (rounding down), use the `div` function, as in `div 16 3` (which will give `5`).
- `%` is not used as the 'modulo' operator. Use the `mod` function instead, as in `mod 16 3` (which will give `1`)
- Using `-` as a unary negative sign (as in `-2`) rather than a subtraction operator (as in `5 - 2`) can cause problems. Always enclose such a negative number in parentheses: `(-2)`.
- `!` isn't for Boolean negation (not). Use the `not` function instead, as in `not True` (which will give `False`).
- `!=` is not defined. For 'not equals', use the `/=` operator.
